This section will include updates to the source code.
The pipeline is mostly functional, but at the last moment the remote BLAST stopped working,
so I had to switch to a local setup very quickly. Because of that,
the rule for building the database is missing, and as a result the hit-search step will not work without a local BLAST database.

Overall, this is more of a demonstration of what has been done so far, but I still plan to clean everything up and properly refine some parts with Snakemake.
If someone wants to run the pipeline, please wait for the upcoming updates. ( iLL make them as soon as as possible, I promice)
